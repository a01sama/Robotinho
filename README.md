# Robotinho
The Soccer Playing Robot (Abdul Samad, Zach Ballard, Devante Saenger
We had numerous ideas to start with for this project, but quickly decided on
a soccer playing robot, Robotinho, since we all have a passion for a
superstar named Ronaldinho. Our goal was to complete simple soccer drills
and score a goal at the end of each drill with a celebration dance. The first
work we did was to reshape the Turtlebot with legs to dribble soccer ball.
Then we implemented three main functions for Robotinho,
1. Speech recognition, we created a voice lexicon for pocketsphinx 3 to
recognize our voice commands and convert them into text
commands for Robotinho.
2. Robotinhoâ€™s soccer skills. We wrote a program to have Robotinho
be able to do three soccer drill techniques, diamond, circle and
weave. The main problem here is to figure out a right speed for it to
dribbling the ball as fast as possible without losing the control
especially when it turns.
3. Goal. We programmed Robotinho able to recognize goal door based
on the color (yellow) of the edge and goal.
We won the Roboshow (a celebration event open to the whole college at the
end of 2018 Fall semester) since everyone seemed to love Robotinho and
his soccer skills along with our NYCFC (Who went on to recognize us)
jerseys. We presented our poster in 2019 CCSCNE conference and discussed our reasoning for choosing to build a robot who plays soccer, the inspiration behind it, the problems we faced and
what libraries we used from the ROS system.
